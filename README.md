# FASTKarts GameMode
These files are related to my FASTKarts GameMode add-on made for the indie game Blockland.

Blockland is an online multiplayer game where you build things with bricks.
It's like playing with legos on the internet.
More info: http://blockland.us/

The FASTKarts gamemode is more than just your standard everyday speedkart edit, much more than just adding a /boombox command was done here. Many features have been ported from DeathMatch gamemode to this, and this took lots of effort to get working nicely by all parties involved.

Many of the gamemode's features are configurable with preferences that can be changed ingame through preferences editing mod, like Return to Blockland or Support_Preferences.

# File structure
