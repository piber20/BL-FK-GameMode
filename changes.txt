v8:

Changed prefs into normal $Pref::Server:: prefs. FASTKarts prefs are no longer stored in their own file
You will need to redo your settings, but this should be easier to deal with in the long run.

Removed pref presets

Chat message commands are now nearly identical to source code. This should make the chat safer and more true to default blockland
Because this is nearly default chat, FASTKarts' own flood protection pref has been removed in favor of the default pref

Admin tags have been removed - May be moved to a standalone add-on

Removed hide admin commands pref - admin commands will now always be hidden

Removed pref-changing commands to simplify things - you now need to use Glass or RTB to change the prefs

Players are now killed after 30 seconds of not being in a vehicle
This can be customised with a pref - Setting it to -1 will disable this feature

Speedkarts spawned after the race begins will now spawn powered
