short term:
- make anti support_garage script

long term goals:
- Mario-kart-like powerups, exclusive to a powerup round type that might replace the rocket round type.
- Item boxes distributed throughout the track, just like mario kart.
- Battle tracks using the powerups.
- Sounds that play when you pass a lap, reach the final lap, win the race, and potentially more.
- MicroCars as new karts. (maybe?)
